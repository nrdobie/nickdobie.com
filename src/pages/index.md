    I am a very enthusiastic software engineer with over a decade of
    professional experience and specialize in JavaScript and front-end
    development. In my career I have worked in a variety of industries and roles
    making it easy for me to take on a wide variety of tasks required by the
    team. Wither it is working with a large team or going solo, I strive to
    deliver not only high quality results but something that is compatible and
    performant. I'm a self taught engineer and can quickly learn new languages
    and techniques to improve whatever project I am working on.

        The language I am most comfortable programing in is JavaScript (and
        TypeScript). I have been working with JavaScript for over eight years
        and have a deep understanding of not only the language but how browsers
        run JavaScript. While my expertise in JavaScript has lead me to be more
        focused on the front-end, I have been able to apply my skills from being
        a full-stack engineer into building NodeJS back-ends.

        Six years ago I ran across a framework called Backbone.js and instantly
        fell in love with the potential of single page applications. Since then
        I have learned other SPA frameworks and tricks for optimizing
        performance of an SPA. Today my framework of choice is React and have
        been coaching others on how to program scalable React applications.

        Building a feature rich application is important, but if no one can
        access the application then the features don't matter. This is why I
        have made a point of not only learning how to write feature rich
        applications but ensure they are performant and scalable.
