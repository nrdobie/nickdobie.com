    I knew from an early age that I enjoyed computers and always wanted to know
    how they worked. When I was 12, I picked up Teach Yourself Web Programming
    in 21 Days and I fell in love with web development. After my first taste of
    web development, I would spend hours searching the Internet and reading
    books to learn everything that I could about web programming. Iâ€™d also do
    small projects to see how I could combine what I knew. To this day
    everything I know about web programming I taught myself and continue to keep
    learning and doing small projects. Throughout myself teaching I have found
    that I am able to quickly pick up new languages and techniques.

        The language I am most comfortable programing in is JavaScript (and
        TypeScript). I have been working with JavaScript for over eight years
        and have a deep understanding of not only the language but how browsers
        run JavaScript. While my expertise in JavaScript has lead me to be more
        focused on the front-end, I have been able to apply my skills from being
        a full-stack engineer into building NodeJS back-ends.

        Six years ago I ran across a framework called Backbone.js and instantly
        fell in love with the potential of single page applications. Since then
        I have learned other SPA frameworks and tricks for optimizing
        performance of an SPA. Today my framework of choice is React and have
        been coaching others on how to program scalable React applications.

        Building a feature rich application is important, but if no one can
        access the application then the features don't matter. This is why I
        have learned how to not only write feature rich  applications but
        architect them in a way that allows them to scale to meet demands.
